# ClientsideStory - Phase 1 Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details for Phase 1 of the ClientsideStory project.

## Database Setup

### 1. Create Testimonials Table

The testimonials table has been created with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.testimonials (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  company TEXT NOT NULL,
  quote TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
```

Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been added to ensure that:
- Users can only view, create, update, and delete their own testimonials
- Public users can view testimonials for public profiles

### 2. Update Users Table

The users table has been updated with the following columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verification_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS accent_color TEXT DEFAULT '#6366f1',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_views INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```
